(This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).)

## Getting started

Run `npm install` to get the dependencies.

### To start locally: `npm start`

Runs the app locally in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### To generate production-ready app bundle: `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
The app is ready to be deployed!

### To run unit tests: `npm test`
